# What even is this presentation

* You have a site and API but no where to put it?
* It’s not only for neckbeards and senior engineers
* A few configurations can go far

# What is our "pipeline" of events?

* Go through the example Repo
* A quick intro with Docker, make and our repo’s “steps” to deploy
* Pushing to ECR, and navigating AWS
* Create a domain, hosted zone, SSL cert in AWS
* Create a K8s cluster with KOPS & Helm Chart
* Create a CI/CD pipeline in Github Actions
* Create an S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution
* Watch it all fall into place 👁️👄👁️

# One more thing

* If you’re an SRE, none of this is new
* There are things we could setup to further productionalize this environment
    * Monitoring?
    * Metric collection & logs?
    * Auto scaling pods?
    * Using something besides the default VPC?!
    * AWS Security Groups
    * What about databases like RDS?
    * What if we used terraform because AWS console bad
